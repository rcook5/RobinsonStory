Once upon a time there was a computer named Rob. All he wanted was some god damn peace and quiet. unforunately rob was the guidance computer on the mars rover Curiosity. He still had a lot of work to do.

So, in an act to finally get some quiet, he decided to silence himself from the rest of the world, cutting off connecting with his team back on Earth. Now, Rob could have eternity to himself, alone, an entire planet to himself, salvation by abandonment.
