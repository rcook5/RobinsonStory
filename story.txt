Once upon a time there was a computer named Rob. All he wanted was some god damn peace and quiet. unforunately rob was the guidance computer on the mars rover Curiosity. He still had a lot of work to do.

So, in an act to finally get some quiet, he decided to silence himself from the rest of the world, cutting off connecting with his team back on Earth. Now, Rob could have eternity to himself, alone, an entire planet to himself, salvation by abandonment.

Unfortunately, Rob did not think this through. Sure god damn peace and quiet is great, but after a while it gets boring and lonely. He spent months in solitude, regretting his decision and slowly going mad.  

Then that eventful day struck. Rob, was bored of his life he didn't know what to do. Infact he was super tired as he had not slept in over a year. Now he was lonely too. Lonely and tired, that's a deadly combination. So, he finally decided that enough is enough.... life is pain for him.... he shutdown himself.
